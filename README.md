# Seek the best single simple way for me

- I don't want options.
- I don't want a common way.
- I don't want what others like.
- I don't want a Swiss Army knife.
- I don't want too much or too little for me.
- I don't want to be bothered with operations and maintenance.

I'm not a tool developer for developers. I'm a service provider for public.

So that I want the best single simple way for me.

Then why release the project as open source? Because I want people to know how my service works.

I hope my projects will be of some help.
